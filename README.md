Components:

App

fetchData

exportToCSV

App is the main component of the app. It contains the button to fetch the data, the chart, and the link to export the data to a CSV file.

fetchData is an asynchronous function that fetches the data from the server. It is called when the component mounts.

exportToCSV is a function that exports the data to a CSV file. It is called when the user clicks on the link to export the data.


Explanation:


The App component uses the useState hook to store the data and the useEffect hook to fetch the data when the component mounts.

The useState hook is a React hook that allows you to manage state in your components. It takes two arguments: the initial state and a function that is called to update the state.

The useEffect hook is a React hook that allows you to run side effects in your components. It takes two arguments: a function that is called when the component mounts and a function that is called when the component unmounts.

The fetchData function uses the axios library to fetch the data from the server. It takes one argument: the URL of the data.

The exportToCSV function uses the react-csv library to export the data to a CSV file. It takes one argument: the data to be exported.

The chart is created using the react-chartjs-2 library. It takes two arguments: the data to be displayed in the chart and the options for the chart.
